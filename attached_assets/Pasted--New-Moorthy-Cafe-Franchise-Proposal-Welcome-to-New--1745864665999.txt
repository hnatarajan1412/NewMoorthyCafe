🏛️ A Legacy to Remember!
The history of Moorthy Cafe dates back to 1955, when it was founded by Mr. S. Dhakshina Moorthy and Mrs. Nagavalli Ammal. Originally established as Moorthy Cafe Veg and Non-Veg Hotel, it quickly gained fame for its unique taste and name. The venture began as a humble café in North Main Road, Chidambaram, and evolved into a full-fledged restaurant over the years.
After Mr. Moorthy, his sons took over and expanded the business in line with his vision. As a testament to its success, multiple branches under the New Moorthy Cafe brand have opened across various locations in Chidambaram and other areas.
New Moorthy Cafe offers a wide range of South Indian vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, prepared using exclusive hand-picked spices and ingredients. The food is crafted using traditional methods and a deep commitment to delighting your taste buds.
Since its inception, New Moorthy Cafe has grown in popularity due to its exceptional service quality, generous food portions, and warm ambience — all backed by an experienced team of chefs and management ensuring complete customer satisfaction.
